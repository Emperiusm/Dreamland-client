# Unity 6000.3 LTS Docs Sync Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Update Dreamland and Dreamland-client documentation to align on Unity 6000.3 LTS + URP 17 setup, infra ports, and validation modes.

**Architecture:** Documentation-only updates across two repos. Source of truth for infra ports is Dreamland `docker-compose.yml`, and Unity setup steps are verified via Context7. Keep edits minimal and consistent between repos.

**Tech Stack:** Unity 6000.3 LTS, Unity Hub, URP 17, Docker Compose, MinIO, Redis.

## Repo Worktrees

- Dreamland-client worktree: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3`
- Dreamland worktree: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3`

---

### Task 1: Identify Doc Targets + Current References

**Files:**
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/README.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/alpha-1-validation.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/plans/internal-beta-end-to-end-plan.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/plans/roomplan-capture-integration-plan.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/README.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/DEV_SETUP.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docker-compose.yml`

**Step 1: Scan for version/infra references**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
rg -n "2022\\.3|Unity 2022|Unity|URP|MinIO|Redis|19000|19001|16379|dreamland-infra" README.md docs

cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
rg -n "Unity|URP|MinIO|Redis|19000|19001|16379|dreamland-infra" README.md docs
```

Expected: find outdated Unity 2022.3 references in client docs and confirm infra ports in Dreamland docs.

**Step 2: Confirm actual infra ports**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
sed -n '1,220p' docker-compose.yml
```

Expected: MinIO 19000/19001, Redis 16379.

### Task 2: Pull Latest Unity Hub + URP 17 Guidance via Context7

**Files:**
- Reference only (Context7 output)

**Step 1: Resolve Unity docs**

Use Context7 tool to resolve Unity/URP/Unity Hub docs (library IDs may vary).

**Step 2: Query for Unity Hub install + LTS selection**

Query Context7 for:
- Unity Hub install / add Unity editor version
- Unity 6000.3 LTS install steps
- URP 17 install/upgrade guidance
- iOS build support modules (iOS Build Support, Xcode requirements)

Expected: authoritative guidance snippets to cite in doc updates.

---

### Task 3: Update Dreamland-client Docs for Unity 6000.3 LTS + Validation Modes

**Files:**
- Modify: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/README.md`
- Modify: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/alpha-1-validation.md`
- Modify: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/plans/internal-beta-end-to-end-plan.md`
- Modify: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/plans/roomplan-capture-integration-plan.md`

**Step 1: Update README Unity version**

- Replace Unity 2022.3 LTS with Unity 6000.3 LTS.
- Add a short note referencing Dreamland backend and infra project name (dreamland-infra).

**Step 2: Update alpha-1-validation setup**

- Ensure Unity Hub + Unity 6000.3 LTS + iOS Build Support instructions align with Context7.
- Clarify URP 17 setup steps (upgrade + assign pipeline asset).
- Add infra port details: MinIO 19000/19001, Redis 16379.
- Add validation modes section:
  - Mode A: smoke test (short, verifies basic launch + connectivity)
  - Mode B: end_to_end (full capture → upload → processing → runtime load)

**Step 3: Update plan docs to Unity 6000.3 LTS**

- Replace Unity 2022.3 LTS references in both plan docs.

**Step 4: Verify no 2022.3 references remain in docs**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
rg -n "2022\\.3|Unity 2022" README.md docs
```

Expected: no matches.

---

### Task 4: Sync Dreamland Docs with Client Setup + Infra Naming

**Files:**
- Modify: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/DEV_SETUP.md`
- Modify (if needed): `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/README.md`

**Step 1: Confirm DEV_SETUP includes project name + ports**

- Ensure Docker Compose command uses `dreamland-infra`.
- Ensure MinIO endpoints 19000/19001 and Redis 16379 are explicitly documented.

**Step 2: Ensure Dreamland backend naming is consistent**

- Verify any references to backend name align with “Dreamland backend” language.
- Add a short note if README needs to mention Dreamland backend explicitly.

**Step 3: Cross-check against client docs**

- Confirm client docs reference Dreamland backend and same ports.

---

### Task 5: Final Consistency Pass

**Files:**
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/alpha-1-validation.md`
- Inspect: `/home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3/docs/DEV_SETUP.md`

**Step 1: Global search for infra ports and backend name**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
rg -n "dreamland-infra|MinIO|Redis|19000|19001|16379|Dreamland backend" README.md docs

cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
rg -n "dreamland-infra|MinIO|Redis|19000|19001|16379|Dreamland backend" README.md docs
```

Expected: consistent naming and ports across repos.

**Step 2: Review diffs**

Run:
```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
git status -sb

git diff

cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
git status -sb

git diff
```

Expected: only doc changes.

**Step 3: Optional sanity check**

- No tests required for docs-only changes.

---

### Task 6: Commit (Optional)

**Files:**
- Commit per repo if requested.

**Step 1: Commit Dreamland-client docs**

```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland-client/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
git add README.md docs/alpha-1-validation.md docs/plans/internal-beta-end-to-end-plan.md docs/plans/roomplan-capture-integration-plan.md

git commit -m "docs: align Unity 6000.3 LTS setup and validation modes"
```

**Step 2: Commit Dreamland docs**

```bash
cd /home/codeagent/projects/Dreamland/.worktrees/docs-unity-6000-3
git add docs/DEV_SETUP.md README.md

git commit -m "docs: sync infra naming and ports"
```
